## Our Mission

To build a community of godly men who pursue integrity, spiritual maturity, and leadership through consistent engagement with God’s Word and each other.

## Core Values

- **Gospel** – The foundation of our lives and ministry
- **Scripture** – The source of truth and growth
- **Accountability** – Helping one another stay the course
- **Prayer** – Seeking God together and individually
- **Friendship** – Encouraging relationships that sharpen and support
- **Ministry of the Church** – Actively participating in church life

## Who Can Join

All men are welcome—whether married or single, young or old. We believe every man has a role in the church and a calling to grow in Christlike leadership.

## Our Vision

We aspire to see every man in our fellowship:

- Growing in the knowledge of God’s Word
- Developing as a deacon, lay pastor, or Bible teacher
- Serving as faithful husbands, fathers, and members of the church
- Living as irreproachable witnesses in the world

## What We Do

- Weekly Bible studies and topical discussions
- Group book studies (past studies include *Disciplines of a Godly Man*, *Do More Better*, *Gods at War*, *Marks of a Healthy Church*, *The Measure of a Man*)
- Accountability partnerships and prayer support
- Fellowship over meals and outings
- Addressing men-specific challenges and church life matters

## Our Identity

The name “Men of Integrity” comes from a formative study that challenged us to align our profession of faith with how we live. It continues to reflect our calling to authentic, consistent Christian living.

## Get Involved

- Join us every Saturday morning for study, prayer, and fellowship
- Find a prayer/accountability partner
- Take part in shaping the life of the church through faithful service

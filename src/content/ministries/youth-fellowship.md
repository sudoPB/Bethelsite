## Our Mission

To equip the next generation to grow in faith, biblical knowledge, and Christlike character through discipleship, fellowship, and community engagement.

## What We Do

- Weekly Bible studies through books of the Bible (currently the Gospel of Mark)
- Group discussions based on personal study and reflection
- Social gatherings and fun activities
- Community service and youth-led projects

## Who Can Join

- Students from 10th standard and above
- There is no strict upper age limit—anyone young at heart is welcome!

## Our Approach

- Everyone studies the same material to encourage mentorship and unity
- Youth come prepared having answered study questions during the week
- We emphasize positive peer relationships and growing together

## Why It Matters

We believe in investing in today’s youth as both the present and future of the church. We aim to develop leaders who love God and serve His church faithfully.

> *“Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.”*  
> — 1 Timothy 4:12

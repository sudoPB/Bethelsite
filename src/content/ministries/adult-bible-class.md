## Our Mission

To teach the Word of God faithfully and build a strong biblical foundation in the lives of adults, training them to be spiritually mature and actively involved in ministry.

## Guiding Scripture

> *“Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.”*  
> — 2 Timothy 2:15

## What We Do

- Systematic study of the Bible and Christian doctrines  
- Occasional topical studies relevant to spiritual growth  
- Group discussions to encourage learning and engagement  
- Training adults to participate in other teaching ministries

## A Family-Friendly Format

The Adult Bible Class runs in parallel with Sunday School for children and youth, enabling parents to both set an example and grow alongside their children in faith.

## The “Bible Hour”

During the 2020–21 pandemic, this ministry expanded virtually into a weekday gathering, later called **Bible Hour**. Over time, we covered books such as:

- 2 Chronicles  
- Job  
- Psalms  
- Proverbs  
- Mark  
- All of John’s writings  
- Ezekiel

Though not always in-depth, these sessions cultivated consistency in Bible reading and reflection.

## Looking Ahead

We are now back to weekly **in-person Sunday gatherings** where we continue learning, sharing, and growing together in Christ. These studies remain essential to shaping spiritually strong individuals who are active in the church and examples to the next generation.

## Get Involved

All adults are welcome—whether new in the faith or spiritually mature. Come ready to learn, grow, and contribute to the life of the church through God’s Word.

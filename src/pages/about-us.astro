        <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          Our church adheres to these fundamental Christian beliefs
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto prose prose-lg">
        <h3>The Scriptures</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as verbally
          inspired and inerrant in the original writings, and that they are the
          supreme and final authority in faith and life.
        </p>

        <h3>The Godhead</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in one God, eternally existing in three Persons: Father,
          Son, and the Holy Spirit.
        </p>

        <h3>The Person of Jesus Christ</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Spirit and born
          of Mary, a virgin, and is true God and true man.
        </p>

        <h3>The Nature of Man</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that man was created in the image of God, that he sinned
          and thereby incurred not only physical death but also spiritual
          death—which is separation from God—and that all beings are born with a
          sinful nature and are sinners in thought, word, and deed.
        </p>

        <h3>The Atonement of Christ</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to
          the Scriptures as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice, and
          that all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed
          blood.
        </p>

        <h3>Eternal Security</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the eternal security of the believer—that it is
          impossible for one born into the family of God ever to be lost.
        </p>

        <h3>The Resurrection and Ascension of Christ</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord, in
          His ascension into heaven, and in His present life there as High
          Priest and Advocate.
        </p>

        <h3>The Blessed Hope</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the “Blessed Hope”—the personal, pre-millennial,
          pretribulational, and imminent return of our Lord and Savior Jesus
          Christ, when the Church will be “gathered together unto Him”.
        </p>

        <h3>The Future of Israel</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the literal fulfillment of the prophecies and promises
          of the Scriptures which foretell and assure the future regeneration
          and restoration of Israel as a nation.
        </p>

        <h3>Salvation by Faith</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that all who receive by faith the Lord Jesus Christ are
          born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby become the children of God.
        </p>

        <h3>The Resurrection and Eternal State</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and unjust, the
          everlasting blessedness of the saved, and the everlasting punishment
          of the lost.
        </p>

        <h3>Ordinances of the Church</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that the Scriptural ordinances of the church are Baptism
          and the Lord’s Supper, and are administered to believers only, as a
          symbol of their belief in the death, burial, and resurrection of our
          Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and as a testimony to the world of that
          belief and of their death, burial, and resurrection with Him; and that
          the Lord’s Supper should be partaken of by believers only to show
          forth His death, “till He come”.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ministry of the Holy Spirit</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that the Holy Spirit is a Divine Person; that He inspired
          the Scriptures using human authors; that He convicts the world of sin,
          of righteousness, and of judgment; that He regenerates those who
          believe, places them into the body of Christ, and dwells in them; that
          as Christ’s representative on earth, He calls out a people from Jews
          and Gentiles and makes of the two “one new man”; and that He calls out
          people to God’s service and empowers and directs them in that service.
          We believe that certain gifts of the Holy Spirit—such as speaking in
          tongues and miraculous healings—were intended only for the Apostolic
          Era of the Church.
